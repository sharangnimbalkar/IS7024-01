    <h2>Geology</h2>

    <p>
        The mountain range was formed by the same historical events [2] that gave birth to the Western Ghats. Resting on the Deccan Plateau geologically identified as a large igneous province, it consists of solidified Flood basalt dating back to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> era.

    <h2>Geography and topography</h2>

    <p>
        The peak along with the adjoining hills spans along a downward-slanting east to west axis eventually merging with the formidable escarpment of the western ghats at almost right angles.Along its length they form a natural boundary demarcating the Igatpuri Taluka, Nashik district at its north from the Akole Taluka, Ahmednagar district at its south.The mountain itself lies on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Plateau">Deccan Plateau</a> with its base at an elevation of 587 meters (1926 feet) above mean sea level.

        The mountain along with adjoining hills forms an enormous catchment area for the Arthur Lake which it overlooks.
